        Think about your family as a resource. If you don't have a traditional family, that doesn't mean you won't be able to 
        reach your fitness goals. Define family in whatever terms work for you. What are some strengths your family has 
        that can help you achieve your goal? Consider the quality of your relationships, shared family values, common activities 
        and traditions, conflict management, and loyalty.

        We get together most Sundays for dinner to reconnect. My mom and I text each other daily about our workout progress."
