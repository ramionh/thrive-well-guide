      Time is one of the biggest challenges to making change. It may not be easy to devote time to focusing on a 
      change (especially one that is not fun in the moment), and it might feel impossible to fit one more 
      activity into a busy schedule. But time management can help you get a handle on your schedule and find 
      the time you need.
