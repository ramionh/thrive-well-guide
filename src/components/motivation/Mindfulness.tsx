          If you're a worrier, you probably find it hard to still your thoughts. If you struggle with this, you might want to try mindfulness, 
          which is a method of calming your mind and body by being present in the moment. Mindfulness involves observing your surroundings 
          through all your senses, putting these observations into words, and staying in the moment. This practice can help calm your anxiety, 
          reduce stress, and keep you focused on your fitness goals.

          If all that sounds intimidating, don't worryâ€”you don't have to figure out how to be mindful on your own. There are many techniques 
          to help people experience mindfulness, including meditation, which focuses attention and awareness. There are many different forms 
          of meditation, and a lot of meditation resources to help you get started, including websites and phone apps.

          Pick a five-minute meditation from any site or app. If you don't know where to start, Mindful.org has a section called 
          Meditation 101: Simple Guided Meditations, which is full of simple guided meditations.
